## Report

This academic project aimed to create a mobile application in the form of a store, utilizing concepts learned in the Mobile App 1 course at the Computer Science program.

The application is a product store targeting the Beyhive (fans of Beyonc√©) in celebration of the artist's new world tour.

The store is categorized into CD, DVD, Vinyl, and Merchandise, with one representative item from each category.

The provided code includes several key components. The `MainActivity` class handles user authentication by sending a login request to a fake API. Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the `ProductCategoriesActivity`, which displays the categorized products. Each product is shown with its details, including title, fee, description, and an image. Users can add items to their cart, which is managed by the `CartListActivity`. The cart displays the selected items, calculates the total fee, tax, delivery charges, and overall total. The code also includes a `CategoryDomain` class representing a product category.

However, based on the video provided, there was an error on the Checkout page, where the purchase values and delivery charges were expected to be displayed.

I hope you will consider the effort put into this project.
